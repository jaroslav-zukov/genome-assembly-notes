TODOs:
- make the home page tell the whole idea from the start to finish and refer to more details
	- it should be enough to just read the home page to understand everything
- structure the pages - introduce separation of concerns
	- my ideas and ideas of others
	- theoretical ideas
		- high level overview
		- parsing and encoding in Rn
		- graph theory and 

___
Write smaller implementational proposals, small research problems like
1. how de Brujin graph assembly works - implement smaller version of it, explain in detail in a note
2. How to extract raw signal from nanopore data - from fast5/pod5 - get the 'squiggle'
3. How to do an FFT on a squiggle, what's the output, how to store it?
4. How to resquiggle the sequence using the dorado basecaller to produce synthetic data
5. Weekend project initiative - deep down research and take notes
	1. Read the code and describe how it works (run, test, play)
		1. Flye
		1. canu
		1. Spades
