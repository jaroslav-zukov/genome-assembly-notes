>[!Warning]- DRAFT

Why? We have already a couple of [[Existing theoretical approaches]] and [[Existing assemblers]] that produced the first complete human genome reference in 2022.

There are several things that are not optimal and could be improved.

- Theoretical drawbacks of current approaches
- greedy approaches â†’ lower precision of the assembly graphs
- software weren't designed in GPU clusters in mind
	- not parallel algorithms
- use of old software packages (legacy dependance)
- complicated execution
	- several complex steps (bottlenecks)
	- use of different tools
