As a first step I would like to try running most popular assemblers (Verkko, Hifiasm, Flye) as well as your method with Pore-C; constructing draft genomes, computing different metrics that are used for comparing assemblies; and also constructing and visualizing the graphs.  


Run simple assembly, visualize and benchmark resulting assembly graphs
	- [[Verkko]]
	- [[Hifiasm]]
	- [[Flye]]
	- [[Canu]]
	- [[Shasta]]
Create a short overview/presentation/description of the inner workings and computational complexity of those solutions. How the computational resources are utilized?

### Step by step

1. Basecall the current [[pod5]] files
2. Analyze and outline the approach
	1. [[Verkko]]
	2. [[Hifiasm]]
	3. [[Flye]]
	4. [[Canu]]
	5. [[Shasta]]
3. Run those with pig data
4.
