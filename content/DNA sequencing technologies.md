 The most prominent sequencing technologies used by the genome assemblers at the moment are:
- [[Oxford Nanopore Technologies]] (ONT)
	- length: 10 - 30 kbp (1000 bp)
	- accuracy: ~95%
	- cost: ~$1/kb
- Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) â†’ ~5kb
	- length: 10 - 15 kbp
	- accuracy: ~99%
	- cost: ~$10/kbp
- Illumina Sequencing NGS
	- length: 150-300 bp
	- accuracy: close to 100%
	- cost: ~$0.1/kb
