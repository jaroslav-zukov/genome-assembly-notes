### How to get to that goal step by step?
1. Understand how current assemblers work
2. Play around and experiment
	1. try implementing and parallelising algorithms myself
	2. run the existing assemblers, measure and compare them
	3. try generating synthetic nanopore data - resquiggling
3. Talk to the genome assembler experts
	1. pitch the project
	2. ask for advice (what pitfalls to avoid)
4. Build the strong team of
	1. programmers with
		1. understanding of parallel compute
		2. solid industry background (sorry academics)
		3. clean code and best practices understanding
	2. graph theorists
	3. assembler experts
	4. nanopore support and direct feedback 
		1. (fast track PhD? XD)
		2. maybe get employed there?
	5. Funding + support
		1. Chan+Zuckerberg foundation?
5. Create the cleanest bioinformatics codebase ever
	1. the fastest and most precise de novo assembler
	2. make it public for everybody to use
	3. write a bachelor/PhD thesis with it


Describe concrete experiments that could be done - smart description
Communicate to LMU professors first, before starting those experiments
