I'm a bachelor student at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t Munich, doing mathematics major and biology minor. I also have a background in software engineering - backend engineer in Java/Kotlin stack in FinTech industry. 

Recently I did an internship inside the Bioinformatics Core Facility ([link](https://www.compbio.bmc.med.uni-muenchen.de/index.html)) under a supervision of [Dr. Tobias Straub](https://www.compbio.bmc.med.uni-muenchen.de/about_us/people/straub/index.html). During the internship I worked with [[Oxford Nanopore Technologies]] data, trying to understand the methylation patterns. I created there a tool for visualizing single molecule modifications - [Modiview](https://github.com/jaroslav-zukov/modiview)

At the moment I'm taking a Discrete Mathematics course by [Prof. Dr. Konstantinos Panagiotou](https://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~kpanagio/), where we learn about graph theory and in particular [[random graphs]].

I always dreamed about bridging the gap between mathematicians, biologists and programmer. Bringing them together and working towards common goal. So I'm immensely happy to pursue this biologically relevant, computationally heavy and mathematically complex project.

Here's my CV
